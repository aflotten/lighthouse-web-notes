### Tips

Experiment with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, "&&", "||") in the node REPL, which you can launch using the node command in Vagrant.

Work your code in small pieces (iteratively)

To help with the lunch time function we can console log the parameters to see what we are passing through! See below:

```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);
}```
